OOP - Allows us to represent and collect more complex data

2 big things - classes & objects

1. classes - represent a thing ie: a student
2. objects - specific examples of a thing ie: a student called Alex

By creating our own classes, we can group things in logical units.
We define a blueprint for what we want the class to store and how it should behave.

class = student and we want it to store name and subject.

We can then instantiate a class into an object. This is where you will populate the object with the data the class requires. 

object 1 = Alex, Python 
object 2 = Kelly, Java
